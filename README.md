# test-sinatra-app
This is coded in Ruby and Javascript. It was developed because there is currently 40% of the population that didn't vote
and even more that arent registered. It basically shows which MP and party you should vote for based on your views. You 
input your postcode and then it finds your constituency and displays your location in google maps. The radio buttons should 
be checked to your views and using a point system you should get an alert when you press submit with your MP and party to vote
for.
